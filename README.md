# Timed-Quiz
Alex centeno
I have been tasked with creating a quiz that is timed and at the end you are able to save your high score. This Quiz has a 20 second timer that is decreased by 5 seconds on an inccorrect answer and adds 5 seconds when you get the answer correct. The Quiz has 5 questions and saves the users initial and points score at the end of the app.
